# Presenting four DIMMs to Mac OS correctly

If you have four DIMMs installed on your mainboard, great!

Your values from using dmidecode (described previously) might be similar to this:

```

## Edit your OpenCore config.plist file

You will edit your OpenCore EFI config.plist file to enter these values correctly.

* Mount your EFI partition
* Navigate to the EFI folder, OC folder, and edit your config.plist file using your favorite plist editor.
* Open the `PlatformInfo` section.
* Set the value of the `CustomMemory` field to `true` (or 1, or YES, depending on your editor).

![](../images/post-install/memory-md/memory-platforminfo-custommemory.png)

> If the CustomMemory key is not present, manually add it or copy it from one of the example plist files to the config.plist.

---

Under the `PlatformInfo` section there will be a `Memory` section. Open the `Memory` section.

> If the Memory section is not present, manually add it or copy it from one of the example plist files to the config.plist.

Set the values here using the values you discovered from your physical RAM.

E.G. Using our example data seen above...

`DataWidth` = 64

`ErrorCorrection` = 3

`FormFactor` = 9

`MaxCapacity` = 824633720832

`TotalWidth` = 64

`Type` = 26

`TypeDetail` = 128

> Remember, the `MaxCapacity` value is dependent upon the type of processor fitted to an Apple Mac Pro 7,1. See [Mac Pro (2019) memory specifications](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT210405). The value should be one of:

| Max RAM | Expressed as bytes |
|---------|--------------------|
| 768GB | `824633720832` |
| 1.5TB | `1649267441664` |

---

Under the `Memory` section there will be a `Devices` section. Open the `Devices` section.

> If the Devices section is not present, manually add it or copy it from one of the example plist files to the config.plist.

We are going to "populate" the 12-slots with four DIMMs. Referring back to [Install and replace memory in your Mac Pro (2019)](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT210103?cid=macOS_UI_Memory_article_HT210103) we can see that our four DIMMs need to go into slots 3, 5, 8, and 10.

In the config.plist file Devices section...

| Item number | Is Slot | Referenced as |
|-------------|---------|---------------|
| 0 | is slot 8 | referenced as Channel A / DIMM 1 |
| 2 | is slot 10 | referenced as Channel B / DIMM 1 |
| 6 | is slot 5 | referenced as Channel D / DIMM 1 |
| 8 | is slot 3 | referenced as Channel E / DIMM 1 |

![](../images/post-install/memory-md/memory-platforminfo-memory-devices-populated.png)

All other items should be "EMPTY" slots.

The important key is the `Manufacturer` key should be set to `NO DIMM` for an empty slot.

Keys `Size` and `Speed` should both be set to `0` for an empty slot.

![Populated Slots](../images/post-install/memory-md/memory-platforminfo-memory-devices-empty-1.png)
![Empty Slots](../images/post-install/memory-md/memory-platforminfo-memory-devices-empty-2.png)

* Save your config.plist file.
* Clear the notification if it is still showing on screen (otherwise, when you restart it will still show even if your memory is now presented correctly!)
* Reboot your system.

If everything goes as planned, the first thing you will notice is the absence of the memory error notification. If that is not enough, check out About This Mac, and drill into the System Profiler memory section.

# Troubleshooting

If you reboot, and you still see the memory warning notification, then something has gone wrong!...

From the Finder's Apple menu, select the About This Mac option.
Click the `Memory` tab. Also, open the System Profiler and select Hardware and then Memory...

| Incorrect About This Mac | Incorrect System Profiler |
| :--- | :--- |

Visually inspect the memory tab's picture.

* Is it showing the correct number of slots (12)?
* Is it showing the correct number of installed DIMMs?
* Is it showing the DIMMs in the correct slots?

* Mount your EFI partition
* Navigate to the EFI folder, OC folder, and edit your config.plist file using your favorite plist editor.
* Open the `PlatformInfo` section.

1. Confirm that the key `CustomMemory` is set to a value of true (or 1, or YES depending on your editor)
   * If this is not set then Mac OS will be presented with data directly from your mainboard, the OpenCore DIMM order will not be shown instead you will see your DIMMs in the wrong slots
   * looking at the Incorrect images above, the About This Mac Memory window is only showing 4 slots. This matches the physical slots on the mainboard. Therefore, the most likely issue is that `CustomMemory` is still set to false.
     * The System Profiler window shows the slot naming convention is not `Slot x ( Channel Y / DIMM N )`, which we expect if we are using the OpenCore `CustomMemory` and the Devices Items are correctly named.

2. If the `CustomMemory` key is correct then the most likely issue is a typing error in the `Devices` section.
   * Double-check that you have 12 items in the `Devices` section, labeled Item 0 - Item 11
   * Double-check that you have populated your DIMM information into the correct Item location
   * Double-check that the other Item locations are set up to be "empty"
     * Ensure the "empty" slots set the `Manufacturer` string value to `NO DIMM`
     * Ensure the "empty" slots set the `Size` integer value to `0`
     * Ensure the "empty" slots set the `Speed` integer value to `0`

3. Check your integer values. When looking at screenshots of Xcode, integer values are shown with comma separators for large numbers
   * e.g. 824633720832 is displayed as `824,633,720,832`
   * When you are entering large numbers enter them **without** the commas (`824633720832`)

4. Make any corrections
5. Save the config.plist file
6. Reboot
7. Confirm

On the [previous page](memory-gathering-data.md) we learned how to gather the correct values using dmidecode.

On the [next page](memory-presenting-other-multiples.md) we will look at the layout for other multiples, including what to do if your mainboard only has two physical slots...
