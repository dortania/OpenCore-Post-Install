# FileVault

FileVault is macOS's built-in drive encryption, and with OpenCore support for it has been drastically improved compared to the legacy Clover drivers.

To start, you'll need the following .efi drivers:

* OpenRuntime.efi
  * [OpenUsbKbDxe.efi](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/releases) for DuetPkg users(systems without UEFI support)

**Do not use VirtualSMC.efi with OpenCore, its already baked inside**. You do however require VirtualSMC.kext still

Setting in your config.plist:

* Misc -> Boot
  * `PollAppleHotKeys` set to YES(While not needed can be helpful)
* Misc -> Security
  * `AuthRestart` set to YES(Enables Authenticated restart for FileVault 2 so password is not required on reboot. Can be considered a security risk so optional)
* NVRAM -> Add -> 4D1EDE05-38C7-4A6A-9CC6-4BCCA8B38C14
  * `UIScale` set to `02` for high resolution small displays
* UEFI -> Input
  * `KeySupport` set to YES(Only when using OpenCore's builtin input, users of OpenUsbKbDxe should avoid)
* UEFI -> Output
  * `ProvideConsoleGop` to YES
* UEFI -> ProtocolOverrides
  * `FirmwareVolume` set to YES
  * `HashServices` set to YES for Broadwell and older(this includes X99), this is needed for systems with broken SHA-1 hashing
* UEFI -> Quirks
  * `RequestBootVarRouting` set to YES
  * `ExitBootServicesDelay` set to `3000`-`5000` if you receive `Still waiting for root device` on Aptio IV firmwares(Broadwell and older)

With all this, you can proceed to enable FileVault like on a normal mac under `System Preferences -> Security & Privacy -> FileVault`
