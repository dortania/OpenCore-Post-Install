# Apple Secure Boot

* Note: DmgLoading, SecureBootModel and ApECID require [OpenCore 0.6.1](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/releases) or newer

## DmgLoading

Quite a simple setting however important in regards to Apple Secure Boot. This setting allows you to set load policy with DMGs in OpenCore. By default we recommend using `Signed` however for best security  `Disabled` may be preferred.

Possible options for `Misc -> Security -> DmgLoading`:

| Value | Comment |
| :--- | :--- |
| Any      | Allows all DMGs to load in OpenCore, however this option will cause a boot failure Apple Secure Boot is enabled |
| Signed   | Allows only Apple-signed DMGs like macOS installers to load |
| Disabled | Disables all external DMG loading, however internal recovery is still allowed with this option |

## SecureBootModel

SecureBootModel is used set the Apple Secure Boot hardware model and policy, allowing us to enable Apple's Secure Boot with any SMBIOS even if the original SMBIOS did not support it(ie. no T2 present on pre-2017 SMBIOS). Enabling SecureBootModel is the equivalent of ["Medium Security"](https://support.apple.com/HT208330), for Full Security please see [ApECID](#apecid)

Currently the following options for `Misc -> Security -> SecureBootModel` are supported:

| Value    | SMBIOS                                  | Minimum macOS Version |
| :---     | :---                                    | :---                  |
| Disabled | No model, Secure Boot will be disabled. | N/A                   |

### Special Notes with SecureBootModel

* Generally `Default` is more than adequate to use however if you plan to have use this with ApECID for full security, we recommend setting a proper value(ie. closest to your SMBIOS or versions of macOS you plan to boot) since the `Default` value is likely to be updated in the future.
* The list of cached drivers may be different, resulting in the need to change the list of Added or Forced kernel drivers. 
  * ie. IO80211Family does not need to be injected in this case.
* Unsigned and several signed kernel drivers cannot be used
  * This includes Nvidia's Web Drivers in 10.13
* System volume alterations on operating systems with sealing, like macOS 11, may result in the operating system being unbootable. 
  * If you plan to disable macOS's APFS snapshots, please remember to disable SecureBootModel as well
* Certain boot errors are more likely to be triggered with Secure Boot enabled that were previously not required
  * Commonly seen with certain APTIO IV systems where they may not require IgnoreInvalidFlexRatio and HashServices initially however Secure Boot does.
* On older CPUs (ie. before Sandy Bridge) enabling Apple Secure Boot might cause slightly slower loading by up to 1 second
* Operating systems released before Apple Secure Boot landed (ie. macOS 10.12 or earlier) will still boot until UEFI Secure Boot is enabled.
  * This is due to Apple Secure Boot assuming they are incompatible and will be handled by the firmware just like Microsoft Windows is

::: details Troubleshooting

Due to an annoying bug on Apple's end, certain systems may be missing the secure boot files themselves on the drive. Because of this, you may get issues such as:

```
OCB: LoadImage failed - Security Violation
```

To resolve, run the following in macOS:

```bash
# First, find your Preboot volume
diskutil list

# From the below list, we can see our Preboot volume is disk5s2
/dev/disk5 (synthesized):
   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER
   0:      APFS Container Scheme -                      +255.7 GB   disk5
                                 Physical Store disk4s2
   1:                APFS Volume ⁨Big Sur HD - Data⁩       122.5 GB   disk5s1
   2:                APFS Volume ⁨Preboot⁩                 309.4 MB   disk5s2
   3:                APFS Volume ⁨Recovery⁩                887.8 MB   disk5s3
   4:                APFS Volume ⁨VM⁩                      1.1 MB     disk5s4
   5:                APFS Volume ⁨Big Sur HD⁩              16.2 GB    disk5s5
   6:              APFS Snapshot ⁨com.apple.os.update-...⁩ 16.2 GB    disk5s5s

# Now mount the Preboot volume
diskutil mount disk5s2

# Next lets copy over the secure boot files
sudo cp -a /usr/standalone/i386/. /Volumes/Preboot
```

Now you can enable SecureBootModel and reboot without issue! And since we're not editing the system volume itself we don't need to worry about disabling SIP or breaking macOS snapshots.

## ApECID

ApECID is used as an Apple Enclave Identifier, what this means is it allows us to use  personalized Apple Secure Boot identifiers and achieve ["Full Security"](https://support.apple.com/HT208330) as per Apple's secure boot page(when paired with SecureBootModel).

To generate your own ApECID value, you'll want some form of cryptographically secure random number generator that will output a 64-bit integer. Below we provide an example that can be run if [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) is installed on your machine:

```py
python3 -c 'import secrets; print(secrets.randbits(64))'
```

With this unique 64-bit int, you can now enter it under Misc -> ApECID in your config.plist


However before setting ApECID, there's a few things we need to note:

* Fresh installs with ApECID set to a non-zero value will require a network connection at install time for verification
* SecureBootModel should have a defined value instead of `Default` to avoid issues if the value were to change in later OpenCore versions.
* Pre-existing installs will need to use bless, for this you'll need to first reboot into recovery and run the following command(Replace Macintosh HD with your system's volume name):


```sh
 bless bless --folder "/Volumes/Macintosh HD/System/Library/CoreServices" \
    --bootefi --personalize
```

And something to note when reinstalling the OS is that you may receive "Unable to verify macOS" error message. To work around his issue, you'll want to allocate a dedicated RAM disk of 2 MBs for macOS personalization by entering the following commands in the macOS recovery terminal before starting the installation:

```sh
disk=$(hdiutil attach -nomount ram://4096) 
diskutil erasevolume HFS+ SecureBoot $disk 
diskutil unmount $disk 
mkdir /var/tmp/OSPersonalizationTemp 
diskutil mount -mountpoint /var/tmp/OSPersonalizationTemp $disk
```
