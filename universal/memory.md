# Fixing MacPro7,1 Memory Errors

On macOS Catalina and newer, users of the MacPro7,1 SMBIOS will experience this error on each boot:

| Notification error | About This Mac Error |

| <img width="1362" src=../images/post-install/memory-md/memory-error-notification.png>  | ![](../images/post-install/memory-md/memory-error-aboutthismac.png) |

The exact reason for this error is a bit unknown, however ways to resolve this error have been made possible. The most common way to remove the error is to use [RestrictEvents](https://github.com/acidanthera/RestrictEvents/releases) and we highly encourage all users to use this kext instead.

For those who wish to attempt the legacy mapping way, see the below guide. Note it will require you to map all your DIMMs manually so this will be a time consuming process.

## Mapping our memory

To start, we'll want to grab the following files:

* [CustomMemory.plist](https://github.com/dortania/OpenCore-Post-Install/blob/master/extra-files/CustomMemory.plist.zip)
  * Example setup for using CustomMemory in OpenCore
* [dmidecode](https://github.com/acidanthera/dmidecode/releases)
  * Tool used for extracting SMBIOS info in macOS

Here is a premade file which has properties already set out for you, one you open it you should see the following:

![](../images/post-install/memory-md/CustomMemory-open.png)

From here we see may properties, lets try to break it down:

* [DataWidth](#datawidth)
* [ErrorCorrection](#errorcorrection)
* [FormFactor](#formfactor)
* [MaxCapacity](#maxcapacity)
* [TotalWidth](#totalwidth)
* [Type](#type)
* [TypeDetail](#typedetail)
* [Devices](#devices)
  * [AssetTag](#assettag)
  * [BankLocator](#banklocator)
  * [DeviceLocator](#devicelocator)
  * [Manufacturer](#manufacturer)
  * [PartNumber](#partnumber)
  * [SerialNumber](#serialnumber)
  * [Size](#size)
  * [Speed](#speed)
* [Cleaning up](#cleaning-up)

### DataWidth

Specifies the data width, in bits, of the memory. A DataWidth of 0 and a TotalWidth of 8 indicates that the device is being used solely to provide 8 error-correction bits.

To determine the DataWidth, run the following:

```sh
path/to/dmidecode -t memory | grep "Data Width:"
# Example Output
 Data Width: 64 bits
 Data Width: Unknown
 Data Width: 64 bits
 Data Width: Unknown
 Data Width: 64 bits
 Data Width: Unknown
 Data Width: 64 bits
 Data Width: Unknown
# Final Value
DataWidth = 64
```

### ErrorCorrection

Specifies ECC support:

```
1 — Other
2 — Unknown
3 — None
4 — Parity
5 — Single-bit ECC
6 — Multi-bit ECC
7 — CRC
```

To determine ErrorCorrection, run the following:

```sh
path/to/dmidecode -t memory | grep "Error Correction Type:"
# Example Output
 Error Correction Type: None
# Final Value
ErrorCorrection = 3
```

### FormFactor

Specifies Memory Form Factor

```
1  — Other
2  — Unknown
9  — DIMM
13 — SODIMM
15 — FB-DIMM
```

To determine FormFactor, run the following:

```sh
path/to/dmidecode -t memory | grep "Form Factor:"
# Example Output
 Form Factor: DIMM
 Form Factor: DIMM
 Form Factor: DIMM
 Form Factor: DIMM
 Form Factor: DIMM
 Form Factor: DIMM
 Form Factor: DIMM
 Form Factor: DIMM
# Final Value
FormFactor = 9
```

### MaxCapacity

Specifies maximum supported memory in your system

Type: Bytes

```
8GB   - 8589934592
16GB  - 17179869184
32GB  - 34359738368
64GB  - 68719476736
128GB - 137438953472
256GB - 274877906944
```

### TotalWidth

Specifies the total width, in bits, of the memory, including any check or error-correction bits. If there are no error-correction bits, this value should be equal to DataWidth.

To determine TotalWidth, run the following:

```sh
path/to/dmidecode -t memory | grep "Total Width:"
# Example Output
 Total Width: 72 bits
 Total Width: Unknown
 Total Width: 72 bits
 Total Width: Unknown
 Total Width: 72 bits
 Total Width: Unknown
 Total Width: 72 bits
 Total Width: Unknown
# Final Value
TotalWidth = 72
```

### Type

Specifies memory type

```
1  — Other
2  — Unknown
15 — SDRAM
18 — DDR
19 — DDR2
20 — DDR2 FB-DIMM
24 — DDR3
26 — DDR4
27 — LPDDR
28 — LPDDR2
29 — LPDDR3
30 — LPDDR4
```

To determine Type, run the following:

```sh
path/to/dmidecode -t memory | grep "Type:"
# Example Output
 Type: DDR4
 Type: Unknown
 Type: DDR4
 Type: Unknown
 Type: DDR4
 Type: Unknown
 Type: DDR4
 Type: Unknown
# Final Value
Type = 26
```

### TypeDetail

Specifies other memory type information

```
Bit 0 — Reserved, set to 0
Bit 1 — Other
Bit 2 — Unknown
Bit 7 — Synchronous
Bit 13 — Registered (buffered)
Bit 14 — Unbuffered (unregistered)
````

Combine all that are applicable, example:

```
Bit 13 — Registered (buffered)
Bit 14 — Unbuffered (unregistered)
-----------------------------------
27 = TypeDetail
```

To determine TypeDetail, run the following:

```sh
path/to/dmidecode -t memory | grep "Type Detail:"
# Example Output
 Type Detail: Synchronous
 Type Detail: Synchronous
 Type Detail: Synchronous
 Type Detail: Synchronous
 Type Detail: Synchronous
 Type Detail: Synchronous
 Type Detail: Synchronous
 Type Detail: Synchronous
# Final Value
TypeDetail = 7
```

### Devices

Array of Memory Devices, and where we do out magic to fix the error. In the sample CustomMemory.plist I provided, we have 12 slots listed here. From this, you'll want to open up System Profiler in macOS and look at the Memory tab:

![](../images/post-install/memory-md/system-profiler.png)

Here we see which slots are populated by memory, and which are empty. For filled slots, simply run through the below on how to pull information. For slots that are empty however, you'll want to add some blank information into thinking macOS has populated device. Ensure that by the end, you have 12 total slots filled with devices.

Example of filled slots vs fake:

![](../images/post-install/memory-md/memory-example.png)

We recommend setting the Size and Speed to both 1, to ensure applications that do pull from memory are not confused that you have more than you should.

## Cleaning up

Now that you've built the table, we can now merge it into our config.plist.

Simply copy over your work from the CustomMemory.plist and paste it into PlatformInfo:

![](../images/post-install/memory-md/memory-example-done.png)

Once this is copied over, enable `PlatformInfo -> CustomMemory` and reboot. The error should be no more now!

Reminder that you must **fill** all 12 slots with memory, otherwise the error will not disappear:
