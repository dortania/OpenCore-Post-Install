# Security and FileVault



So something that makes OpenCore truly special is how it's been built with security in mind which is quite rare especially in the Hackintosh community. Well here we'll be going through and setting up some of OpenCore's great Security features:



* [**FileVault**](./security/filevault)
  * Apple's built-in drive encryption
* [**Vault**](./security/vault)
  * OpenCore's semi-secure boot, used for snapshotting OpenCore so no unwanted changes happen
* [**ScanPolicy**](./security/scanpolicy)
  * OpenCore's drive policy, determines what types of disks show up in OpenCore's boot menu
* [**Apple Secure Boot**](./security/applesecureboot)
  * Apple's variant of secure boot in the macOS kernel
