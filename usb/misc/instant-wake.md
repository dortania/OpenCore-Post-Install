# GPRW/UPRW/LANC Instant Wake Patch

Similar idea to the "Fixing Shutdown/Restart" section, macOS will instant wake if either USB or power states change while sleeping. To fix this we need to reroute the GPRW/UPRW/LANC calls to a new SSDT, verify you have instant wake issues before trying the below.

Best way to check:

```sh
pmset -g log | grep -e "Sleep.*due to" -e "Wake.*due to"
```

And generally you'll get results like these:

* `Wake [CDNVA] due to GLAN: Using AC`
  * Generally caused by WakeOnLAN enabled, try to disable this option first in the BIOS
  * If WOL wasn't the issue, you can try the below patches
* `Wake [CDNVA] due to HDEF: Using AC`
  * Similar to the GLAN issue
* `Wake [CDNVA] due to XHC: Using AC`
  * Generally caused by WakeOnUSB enabled, try to disable this option first in the BIOS
  * GPRW patch is likely needed
* `DarkWake from Normal Sleep [CDNPB] : due to RTC/Maintenance Using AC`
  * Generally caused by PowerNap
* `Wake reason: RTC (Alarm)`
  * Generally caused by an app waking the system, quitting said app before you sleep should fix it

**Do not use all these patches at once**, look through your DSDT and see what you have then add the corresponding SSDT and ACPI Patch:
